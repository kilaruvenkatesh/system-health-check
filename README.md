#  System Health Check Script

##  Overview
`healthcheck.sh` is a simple Bash script designed to monitor system health.  
It checks and logs system metrics like uptime, CPU load, memory usage, disk usage, and top memory-consuming processes.  
It also verifies if key services (like **nginx** or **ssh**) are running.

The script saves all data with timestamps into `healthlog.txt`.
